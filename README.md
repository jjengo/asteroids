### Overview

An original rendition of the classic arcade game Asteroids written in Python. The game was designed with priority to staying true to the original with line segment graphics, original sounds, and animation. I added my own twist to the graphics with particles, fading, and line segment explosions.

Inspiration for the classic arcade game came from the following website:
